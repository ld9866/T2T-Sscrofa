# T2T-Sscrofa
The domestic pig is a key agricultural species and biomedical model, yet its reference genome has remained incomplete. Using PacBio HiFi, Oxford Nanopore reads, and Hi–C sequencing, we assembled the first telomere–to–telomere (T2T), gap–free pig genome (T2T–Sscrofa). This assembly resolves 274.8 Mb of previously unassembled sequence, including centromeres, segmental duplications, and ribosomal DNA arrays, and identifies 255 new protein–coding genes. Comparative analyses reveal a Robertsonian translocation in the western European wild boar and extensive structural variation across global pig populations. T2T–Sscrofa provides a comprehensive genomic foundation for agricultural, evolutionary, and biomedical research.
